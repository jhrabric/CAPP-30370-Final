This is a basic layout for a site that I created for my Dad's business
Simpson Realty. He owns property and rents it out around our area.I am 
going to add all of his listings when I get home and home to expand the 
site. 

The three column layout is the fourth link in the navigation. I included 
it as a separate page because it did not fit in with the other three pages. 
In the future, I will go back and change all of the pages to have this three
column layout.

The CSS animation on a continuous loop is on the Home page with the div id="flash"
The CSS markup for it should be on the top of the style sheet.

The CSS animation that runs on user interaction is on each page for the #pagewrap h1
attribute. If you run your mouse over the text it expands and changes color. 
The CSS is at the bottom of the style sheet.

The background image is styled for the #header on the 3 Column Layout page.

The visual jquery interaction is on the 3column page where you click the button that says
"Hide the House".
